Usually, the environments are thought to have a great number of degrees of freedom and are slightly affected by the system. In this framework, only the dynamics of the system draws interests. Therefore, our aim is obtaining the time evolution equation for the reduced density operator. </p> <p>One numerically exact approach is the dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism, which is a secondary quantization generation of the hierarchical equations of motion formalism. Based on the dissipaton decomposition and dissipaton algebra, DEOM maps the total Hilbert space dynamics to the DEOM space, namely </p> \\[  \\dot{\\rho}_{\\tiny\\rm T}(t) = -i\\mathcal{L}_{\\tiny\\rm T}(t)\\rho_{\\tiny\\rm T}(t) \\Longrightarrow \\dot{\\boldsymbol\\rho}(t) = -i\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{L}}(t)\\boldsymbol\\rho(t), \\] <p>where the dynamical variable \\(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}(t)\\equiv\\{\\rho_{\\bf n}^{(n)}(t)\\}\\) is a set of dissipaton density operators (DDOs) with the same dimension as the system part. The DDOs not only contain the dynamical information of the system, but also describe the entanglement effects between the system and environments. The only assumption of the DEOM mapping is that environments can be only characterized by the bare-bath time correlation function, also named as Gaussian environment ansatz.</p> <p>Our research mainly contains: </p> <ul> <li> <p>the development of DEOM theory,</p> </li> <li> <p>the applications of DEOM in physical and chemical problems.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"research/#condensed-phase-reaction-dynamics","title":"Condensed phase reaction dynamics","text":"<p>The chemical reactions are considered as a series of dynamical processes upon the potential energy surfaces, which results from the Born-Oppenheimer separation. For chemical reactions occurring in condensed phases, the solvent environment plays a critical role, such as the solvation effect. </p> <p>In this context, we naturally apply the open quantum theories to study the dynamics of condensed phase reactions. DEOM, serving as the most rigorous and comprehensive method, can not only give the time-dependent populations of the process, but also presents the reaction rate kernels. With the help of DEOM, we have systematically study the electron transfer and energy transfer processes in many aspects, including the rate constant, rate kernel, Floquet modulation, etc.</p> <p>Apart from the population dynamics, DEOM can also solve the case when the Hamiltonian is shown in the coordinate/momentum representation, which is what we currently are going on. </p>"},{"location":"research/#statistical-mechanics-in-small-systems","title":"Statistical mechanics in small systems","text":"<p>For small systems under nano scale, the non-extensiveness and quantum properties can not be ignored and manifestly affect the system's behavior. In our research, we start from the dynamics of open quantum systems to resolve some basic thermodynamic quantities for certain processes, such as the mixing of a small system with a large bath. Our aim is to identify some universal thermodynamic properties for small systems.</p>"},{"location":"travel/","title":"Travel &amp; Miscellaneous","text":""},{"location":"travel/#airport-or-railway-station-pickup","title":"AIRPORT or RAILWAY STATION PICKUP","text":"<p> Picking up from the Hefei airport or railway station is available if necessary traveling information was sent to the organizers on time.  </p>"}]}
